This repository shows a demonstration on how to access obs virtual camera through open cv, as many developers were facing the problem to access obs virtual camera so that they can capture a specific window or video which was unable to be accessed by open cv directly

###Step-1
#Open the window 
Open the window you want to be captured by open-cv in real time for instance i want my shop camera to be accessed through web so i will open that in a seperate window
